# react-seed-es6+ 
straight javascript seed starter project with redux, notifications, middleware in place

## current features

 

- api error handling and notification for regular and ML errors

- block ui screen during http calls

- task displays both redux-saga and redux-promise

- mirror sends requests on a round trip to display error handling

- proxy handling to prevent CORS issues (see package.json proxy)

- notification popups via toastify ()

 

## IDE Dependancies
 

if using visual studio code, install the latest version, then install the extension: 

 

- ES7 React/Redux/-  GraphQL/React-Native snippetsds

[https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-best-react-extension-for-vs-code](https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-best-react-extension-for-vs-code)

- Jest: with this vs code will automatically run tests on files that change

 

## proxy configuration in Dev


in package.json, there is a proxy setting to reduce CORS issues during development. 


## backend


by default the project comes with the following backends that have a simple ToDo app:

 
- /server-koa: arguably better than express, support asynchronous calls. If you're more used to .Net this will probably be a pleasant surprise
    to run: in terminal, navigate to folder then:
    > npm i
    > npm start

    although it's bypassed for this example, note the following features:
    -- jwt auth capabilities with api for register, reset pass
    -- graphql path
    -- mongodb initialation wired in (requires install or connection link to mongodb)

- /server/net-server: (pending completion) run and install for the front end to reach an api 

### Backend Testing: 
 use the following postman public link to test the api independantly of front end:

## jest unit testing

 

In vs code install extension "jest", VS code will now automatically run tests and show in bottom left notificatin bar.

 

in windows command prompt, also run >npm run test to see colorized commentary of tests

 

tests are next to files as *.test.tsx

 

for a quick sample, in home.test.tsx, change the value in "it ('has a header')" from true to false

 

For more complex examples that use the redux store and mockups, look at task*.test.tsx

 

## task/requested features

 

- private routes based on user role

- integration with GE pipeline

 

### libraries used

 

- axios

- bootstrap

- lodash (array and null handling)

- moment (better date handling)

- node-sass (adds support for scss files, also pulls bootstrap in from /scss/custom.scss)

- react

- react-dom

- react-redux

- react-router-dom

- react-scripts

- react-toastify (adds notification pop ups)

- react-widgets

- react-widgets-moment

- reactstrap (prefer the implementation over react-bootstrap)

- redux

- redux-form (simplifies form management in state)

- redux-form-input-masks

- redux-forms

- redux-logger

- redux-promise (redux middleware for simple api calls)

- redux-saga (middleware for more complex api calls or data massaging)

- validator

 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
